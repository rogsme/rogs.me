# Introduction

Hello world! I'm a Backend web developer from Valencia, Venezuela, but now
living in [Montevideo, Uruguay](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2929054).

I have experience in front-end, back-end, and DevOps. New technologies fuel my
desire to learn more and more each day. I try to keep my code as clean as
possible, following established standards for the technology I'm using at the
moment.

I love Open Source projects. Knowledge should be available to everyone who wants
it.
