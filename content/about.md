I'm an experienced back-end developer and a DevOps enthusiast. I've been using Linux since 2010, so the terminal comes as second nature to me.

Like I mentioned on the [home page](/), I have a passion for selfhosting as many digital services as I can. Here's my full selfhosted list (updated Jan 15th 2023):

- My website (you are here now lol): [rogs.me](https://rogs.me)
- My email: [roger@rogs.me](mailto:roger@rogs.me)
- My Git server: [git.rogs.me](https://git.rogs.me)
- A personal wiki: [wiki.rogs.me](https://wiki.rogs.me)
- A Calendar server: [calendar.rogs.me](https://calendar.rogs.me)
- A Matrix instance: [chat.rogs.me](https://chat.rogs.me)
- A private searx instance: [searx.rogs.me](https://searx.rogs.me)

## Job history

If you want to know more about my job history, you can go to my [resume](/resume) page. I chose to leave that section outside of the main menu because only recruiters / linkedin people are going to care about that.

## Pets
I have 4 cats. In order of adoption:
- Cuca â™€: Feb 19th 2021.
- Papo â™‚: May 2nd 2021.
- Chocha â™€: Sept 17th 2022.
- Bollo â™‚: Sept 17th 2022.

## Tatoos
So far, I have 7 tatoos:
- Right arm:
  + A rose on my hand.
  + A big rose on my forearm.
  + The two robots holding hands on the cover of Pink Floyd's [Wish you were here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)#/media/File:Wish_you_were_here_by_Pink_Floyd_banner.png).
  + The 4 symbols representing each Led Zeppelin member.
- Left arm:
  + A skull on my hand.
  + A snake with roses on the forearm.
  + The cover of Pink Floyd's album [The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon#/media/File:Dark_Side_of_the_Moon.png).

## Religion
I'm a Christian, more specifcially a [Baptist protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists). Right now, I'm not planning on talking about religion on my blog, but **I'm not ruling it out for the future.** I will let the readers know before a religion post comes, in case they want to ignore it.
