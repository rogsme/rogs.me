# Who am I?

Hello world! I'm a Backend web developer from Valencia, Venezuela, but now
living in [Montevideo, Uruguay](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2929054).

I have experience in front-end, back-end, and DevOps. New technologies fuel my
desire to learn more and more each day. I try to keep my code as clean as
possible, following established standards for the technology I'm using at the
moment.

I love Open Source projects. Knowledge should be available to everyone who wants
it.

You can check my resume in a more traditional format here:

# Experience

## [Prometeo OpenBanking](https://prometeoapi.com/)
**Lead Backend Developer**

> September 2021 - Currently

In Prometeo I'm currently working as a Tech Lead, managing a team of 5
developers and working on a few migrations to improve the development experience.

So far I've migrated from Bitbucket and Bitbucket Pipelines to Github and Jenkins,
set up SonarCloud and many other tools to improve security and code quality and
Dockerized their entire microservice infrastructure. As for the future, I'm currently
working on their v2 API, which is going to be done in FastAPI

I also participated on their
[OpenBanking hackathon as a judge](https://prometeoopenbanking.medium.com/as%C3%AD-se-vivi%C3%B3-ignite-36cf01dec347?p=36cf01dec347),
a very enriching experience :)

In Prometeo I'm using Python, aiohttp, Django, Selenium, Jenkins, Github actions,
SonarCloud, Docker, FastAPI, among others.


## [Lazer Technologies](https://lazertechnologies.com/)
**Senior Backend Developer**

> September 2020 - September 2021

In Lazer Technologies I worked on [Certn](https://certn.co/), an app that looks
to ease the employers jobs of doing criminal background checks for their
employees. I was responsible of a big integration with
[Workday](https://www.workday.com/), that led to a multi million dollar per year
contract for Certn. In this project used Django, Django REST Framework, Docker,
PostgreSQL, Github Actions and Jenkins.

## [Tarmac](https://tarmac.io)

> July 2020 - January 2021

In Tarmac I worked on a project called [Volition](/projects/volition/). In
Volition we developed a crawler that extracts information from different pages
in order to build a "super market place" for a specific product. In this project
we used Docker, TypeScript, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. 

## [Massive](https://massive.ag)
**Senior Backend Developer**

> April 2019 - August 2020

I worked for Massive from April 2019 to August 2020. On my time in Massive, I
worked on one big project for Coca-Cola Mexico, called [Tus Tapas
Valen](/projects/tus-tapas-valen). "Tus Tapas Valen" was an application that
allowed clients to participate in promotions and auctions, and win prizes. We
got to 400.000 users in the time the app was online. First I worked FrontEnd
with ReactJS, Redux and redux-observable, but then I moved to the Backend. I had
to plan a big refactor while still working on new Backend functionalities. The
Backend is built using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, and AWS S3

## [Vascar Solutions](https://vascarsolutions.com/)
**Backend Developer**

> December 2016 - June 2019

On my time in Vascar Solutions, I have been in many projects, most recently on

assessments to recommend candidates to a specific job. I worked on the backend
with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, CircleCI, Heroku and AWS.
[Axelerist](/projects/axelerist) is a web app that connects to an external API
and displays the client’s inventory in a more friendly and ergonomic way. I
