# Who am I?

Hello world! I'm a Full-Stack web developer from Valencia, Venezuela, but now
living in [Montevideo, Uruguay](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2929054).

I have experience in front-end, back-end, and DevOps. New technologies fuel my
desire to learn more and more each day. I try to keep my code as clean as
possible, following established standards for the technology I'm using at the
moment.

I love Open Source projects. Knowledge should be available to everyone who wants
it.

You can check my resume in a more traditional format here:

# Experience

## [Lazer Technologies](https://lazertechnologies.com/)
> September 2020

In Lazer Technologies we are working for [Certn](https://certn.co/). Certn is an
app that looks to ease the employers jobs of doing criminal background checks
for their employees. First, we built an app called [International Framework](/projects/certn-intl-framework/) that acts as a bridge between our
main app and criminal background check providers (like the
[RCMP](https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/)). Now we are working on [ADA
DINER](/projects/certn-ada-diner/) a scraper for multiple providers that don't
have an API. In this project we are using Django, Django REST Framework, Docker,
PostgreSQL, Github Actions and Jenkins.

## [Tarmac](https://tarmac.io)
> July 2020

I'm currently working on Tarmac on a project called
[Volition](/projects/volition/). In Volition we are developing a crawler that
extracts information from different pages in order to build a "super market
place" for a specific product. In this project we are using Docker, TypeScript,
NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes.

## [Massive](https://massive.ag)
Senior Backend Developer

> April 2019 - August 2020

I worked for Massive from April 2019 to August 2020. On my time in Massive, I
worked on one big project for Coca-Cola Mexico, called [Tus Tapas
Valen](/projects/tus-tapas-valen). "Tus Tapas Valen" is an application that
allowed clients to participate in promotions and auctions, and win prizes. First
I worked FrontEnd with ReactJS, Redux and redux-observable, but now I'm working
in the Backend. I had to plan a big refactor while still working on new Backend
functionalities. The Backend was built using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS,
and AWS S3 

## [Vascar Solutions](https://vascarsolutions.com/)
Backend Developer

> December 2016 - June 2019

On my time in Vascar Solutions, I have been in many projects, most recently on
Knac and Axelerist. [Knac](/projects/knac) is a job application startup, empathizing on
assessments to recommend candidates to a specific job. I worked on the backend
with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, CircleCI, Heroku and AWS.
[Axelerist](/projects/axelerist) is a web app that connects to an external API
and displays the client’s inventory in a more friendly and ergonomic way. I
worked on the backend, managing the API connection, working on an API wrapper
and user management. The app was made with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mocha,
CircleCI, Heroku and AWS.
