Hey everyone, quick heads up: I'm adding analytics to the blog.

Before you reach for your adblocker, hear me out. I'm using [Umami](https://umami.is/), which is open source, privacy-respecting, and doesn't use cookies. It doesn't track you across sites, doesn't collect personal data, and is fully [open source](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) so you can verify that yourself.

On top of that, I'm self-hosting it on my own infrastructure, so the data never touches a third party. No Google Analytics, no Cloudflare analytics, no one else sees anything.

I mainly want to know which posts are actually useful to people and which ones are just me yelling into the void. That's it.

If you have any questions or concerns, you know where to find me on the [Contact](/contact) page.
