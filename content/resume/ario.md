## What did I work on? {#what-did-i-work-on}

In my role, I have been a key member of the backend team, and my responsibilities have
included:

- Migrating the backend from Tornado to Sanic: This transition has allowed us to leverage
Sanic's asynchronous capabilities, improving the overall performance and scalability of our
system.
- Asynchronous Function Implementation: I moved all blocking operations outside of the main
loop by making the functions async, ensuring non-blocking, efficient operations.
- Enhancing Reminders Functionality: I have worked extensively on the reminders feature,
ensuring timely and accurate notifications for users.
- Improving Push Notifications: I have made significant improvements to our push notification
system, enhancing reliability and analytics.
- Developing a New Scheduler: Currently, I am working on a new scheduler to abstract
asynchronous operations and cron events further by running them in Celery, providing more
robust and flexible task scheduling.
