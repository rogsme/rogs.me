records, education, employment verification, credit reports, etc. On
International Framework, we worked on an app that acts like a bridge between our
main app and criminal background check providers (like the [[https://rcmp-grc.gc.ca][RCMP]]).

- Team lead
- Moved the entire project to docker and docker-compose. Before it, the
  development environment has pretty tricky to setup. 
- Improved the old code, introducing standards with esLint and smoke tests.
- Configured a VPN and an Ubuntu VNC session in docker to help with the proxy
  and the non-headless browser.
- Created new crawlers for the new vendors.
- Configured the new Kibana dashboard.
- Created a gatekeeper to check the crawlers status before going out to the
  internet. 
- Monitored and ran many crawlers.

:END:
"Tus Tapas Valen" was an application that allowed clients to participate in
promotions and auctions, and win prizes. We got to 400.000 users in the time the
app was online. First I worked FrontEnd with ReactJS, Redux and
redux-observable, but then I moved to the Backend. I had to plan a big
refactor while still working on new Backend functionalities. The Backend is
built using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, and AWS S3
