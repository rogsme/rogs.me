# Experience

## [X-Team](https://x-team.com/)
**Senior Backend Developer**

> March 2023 - Currently

As one of X-Team's Senior Developers, I am currently part of the team assigned to collaborate with Under
Armour's team on one of their projects,
[MapMyFitness](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MapMyFitness,+Inc.), which has garnered
more than 30 million downloads in the App Stores.

In this project, I am fully leveraging my Python/Django development skills along with my expertise in
Docker, Kubernetes, and creative problem-solving.

My tasks include:

- Performing general maintenance of their back-end infrastructure to ensure its smooth operation and
  efficiency.
- Leading the migration from an in-house Apache Kafka implementation to Confluent Cloud, streamlining
  data processing and messaging.
- Assisting with the migration from MySQL 5.6 to MySQL 7 to achieve improved database performance and
  functionality.
- Suggesting and designing enhancements to the codebase, contributing to the overall application's
  robustness and scalability.
- Improving their development environment by enabling local backend infrastructure. Previously, they
  faced challenges running the backend locally, which forced them to rely on development servers for
  debugging, resulting in slow and tedious experiences. I was able to make changes to run it locally and
  streamline their debugging processes.
- Mentoring a new Junior developer who recently joined the team, guiding them in understanding and
  effectively working with the codebase.

In X-Team, I am currently utilizing a diverse set of technologies, including Python, Django, Docker,
Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, and Github Actions, among others. This collaborative environment allows me to
continually develop and leverage my expertise in delivering successful projects for high-impact clients
like Under Armour.

## [Prometeo OpenBanking](https://prometeoapi.com/)
**Tech Lead Backend Developer**

> September 2021 - April 2023

At Prometeo, I was the Tech Lead, managing a team of 5 developers. I improved the development process by
migrating from Bitbucket to Github and from Bitbucket Pipelines to Jenkins. I also set up SonarCloud and
other tools to enhance security and code quality. The entire microservice infrastructure was Dockerized
for smoother operations.

I handled daily tasks like code reviews, backend architecture, and database maintenance (MySQL and
Postgres). Additionally, I led new development projects and guided the team to successful completions.
I had the privilege of being a judge in [Prometeo's OpenBanking
hackathon](https://prometeoopenbanking.medium.com/as%C3%AD-se-vivi%C3%B3-ignite-36cf01dec347?p=36cf01dec347),
which was an enriching experience.

In this role, I utilized various technologies, including Python, aiohttp, Django, Selenium, Jenkins,
Github Actions, SonarCloud, Docker, and FastAPI.

Overall, I am proud to have driven positive changes, improving development efficiency and fostering a
collaborative work environment.

## [Lazer Technologies](https://lazertechnologies.com/)
**Senior Backend Developer**

> September 2020 - September 2021

At Lazer Technologies, I worked on [Certn](https://certn.co/), an app designed to simplify employers'
criminal background checks for their employees. One of my major achievements was overseeing a significant
integration with [Workday](https://www.workday.com/), resulting in a multi-million dollar per year
contract for Certn. Throughout this project, I utilized various technologies, including Django, Django
REST Framework, Docker, PostgreSQL, Github Actions, and Jenkins.

My key projects at Certn included:

- Certn - Workday Integration: This crucial integration served as the main link between Certn and
  Workday, facilitating seamless background checks for employers.
- Certn - ADA DINER: I contributed to the development of this app, which allows on-demand crawls to check
  criminal records for specific individuals.
- Certn - International Framework: I played a key role in building this app, acting as a bridge between
  Certn's main platform and criminal background check providers, such as the RCMP.

My work at Certn allowed me to make a significant impact, streamlining their background check process and
contributing to the company's growth and success.

## [Tarmac](https://tarmac.io)
**Senior Backend Developer**

> July 2020 - January 2021

During my time at Tarmac, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project called
[Volition](/resume/volition/). The main objective of Volition was to create a specialized crawler capable
of extracting information from various web pages. This data was then used to build a unique "supermarket
place" dedicated to fasteners and screws.

To ensure efficient development and deployment, our team utilized a range of cutting-edge technologies,
including Docker, TypeScript, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes.

## [Massive](https://massive.ag)
**Senior Backend Developer**

> April 2019 - August 2020

During my tenure at Massive from April 2019 to August 2020, I had the privilege of working on a
significant project for Coca-Cola Mexico called "[Tus Tapas Valen](/resume/tus-tapas-valen)." This
application was designed to enable clients to participate in promotions and auctions, providing them with
opportunities to win exciting prizes. Impressively, the app garnered 400,000 users during its online
presence.

Initially, I worked on the FrontEnd using technologies like ReactJS, Redux, and redux-observable.
However, as the project evolved, I transitioned to the Backend. While simultaneously working on new
Backend functionalities, I also led a substantial refactor to improve the system's overall efficiency.
The Backend was developed using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, and AWS S3, allowing us to create a
robust and scalable foundation for the application.

Working on "Tus Tapas Valen" at Massive was a remarkable experience that allowed me to contribute to the
success of a high-profile project for Coca-Cola Mexico.

## [Vascar Solutions](https://vascarsolutions.com/)
**Backend Developer**

> December 2016 - June 2019

During my time at Vascar Solutions, I had the opportunity to contribute to various projects, with a
particular focus on Knac and Axelerist.

[Knac](/resume/knac) is an innovative job application startup that places emphasis on assessments to match candidates
with specific job opportunities. In this project, I worked on the backend using technologies such as
NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, CircleCI, Heroku, and AWS. My responsibilities involved building the
backend infrastructure, ensuring smooth database operations, and integrating various tools for seamless
deployment and testing.

On the other hand, [Axelerist](/resume/axelerist) is a web application designed to connect with an external API and present
the client's inventory in a user-friendly and ergonomic manner. As part of the backend team, I managed
the API connection, developed an API wrapper, and handled user management. The app was built using
NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mocha, CircleCI, Heroku, and AWS.

Being a part of these projects at Vascar Solutions provided me with valuable experiences in web
application development and utilizing a range of modern technologies. I contributed to the success of
Knac and Axelerist by delivering efficient backend solutions and collaborating effectively with the team
to achieve our project objectives.
