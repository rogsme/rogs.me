## About the project {#about-the-project}

[Certn](https://certn.co) is an app that wants to ease the process of background checks for criminal
records, education, employment verification, credit reports, etc.
On International Framework, we worked on an app that acts like a bridge between our
main app and criminal background check providers (like the [RCMP](https://rcmp-grc.gc.ca)).
