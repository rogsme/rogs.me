## About the project {#about-the-project}

"Tus Tapas Valen" is an application that will allow clients to participate in
promotions and auctions, and win prizes. We are expecting 5 million users for
January 2020. First I worked FrontEnd with ReactJS, Redux and redux-observable,
but now I'm working in the Backend. I had to plan a big refactor while still
working on new Backend functionalities. The Backend is built using Python,
Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, and AWS S3
