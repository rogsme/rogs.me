I'm removing comments from my blog.

I've been thinking about this for a while, but I noticed that comments weren't being used and most posts
were not that interesting. Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate your awesome comments, but running
commento takes a lot of resources and I don't really see the full benefit of them.

From now on, if you want to leave a comment ("thank yous", suggestions, etc), you can send me an email.
You'll find my email addess on the [Contact](/contact) page.

You have a good and relevant comment, I'll update the relevant post accordingly.
