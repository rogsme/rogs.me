# Introduction

Hello world! I'm a Backend web developer from [Valencia, Venezuela](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/272745), but now living in [Montevideo, Uruguay](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2929054).

I have a tendency to selfhost as much of my digital life as I can. Why? beacuse ~~I'm a masochist~~ I like to have control over my information and I want everthing to be as minimal as possible.

The full list of selfhosted software I'm running is in the [about page](/about).

If it not obvious yet, I love Open Source projects ‚ù§Ô∏è. Knowledge should be available to everyone who wants
it.

You can have more information about me in the [about page](/about).
