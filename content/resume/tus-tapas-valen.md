## About the project {#about-the-project}

"Tus Tapas Valen" was an application that allowed clients to participate in
promotions and auctions, and win prizes. We got to 400.000 users in the time the
app was online. First I worked FrontEnd with ReactJS, Redux and
redux-observable, but then I moved to the Backend. I had to plan a big
refactor while still working on new Backend functionalities. The Backend is
built using Python, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS, and AWS S3
